ABOUT:
nodau is a simple console based note taking program, it allows you to
 easily create, edit, and view notes, and search them by name or date

DEPENDENCIES:
nodau requires glibc, ncurses, openssl, and sqlite. It may work with
 other C libraries, but this has not been tested.

INSTALL:
If you're reading this then you've already unpacked the tarball,
so it's the usual 3 steps:
1) cd /path/to/nodau
2) make
3) su -c "make install"

UNINSTALL:
just cd to the nodau directory and run "make uninstall"

USE:
nodau <option> [data]

OPTIONS:
 help            print this message
 list [search]   list notes, accepts optional search term
 new <name>      create new note, name must be unique
 encrypt <name>  encrypt a new or existing note
 decrypt <name>  decrypt an encrypted note
 edit <name>     open an existing note for editing
 show <name>     display an existing note
 del <search>    accepts name or search term

CONFIG:
The nodau config file is located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nodau/nodau.conf
 which is typically ~/.config/nodau/nodau.conf
The following config settings are currently in use:
	SETTING			VALUES
   external_editor       name of a text editor executable (vim,nano,etc)
   force_builtin_editor  true or false
   import_old_db         true or false

SEARCH TERM:
 search terms with spaces do not need to be inside "quotes"
 <name>          name of a note, list will search for names similar to
                  the term, del will delete only an exact match
 t@<datestring>  matches notes created at a given date/time
 t-<datestring>  matches notes created before a given date/time
 t+<datestring>  matches notes created after a given date/time

DATE STRING:
 datestring can be made of any typical date format such as:
 dd/mm/yy
 dd, mm, yyyy hh:mm

EDITING:
 the current editor accepts standard printable characters, enter,
 and backspace. There is no support for moving the cursor with the
 arrow keys or mouse. To exit the editor and save the note, create
 a new line with only a dot (.) on it, or press escape.

nodau is licensed under the GPLv3, there's a copy of it in LICENSE
